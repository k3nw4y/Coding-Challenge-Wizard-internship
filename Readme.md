First We import argphrase to input the image to terminal
We are using opencv 2
Numpy for processing the array

We use argphrase to get the image path and save it ti variable, then convert
it to grey scale, then initializing the array using Numpy 
then using contours, we cropped the words,
we then looped the process intill the no of remaining words get to 0
then saved it to a folder,

the last section is used to show, and close the image
